#8. Add two takeaways you've had from your first few classes of Mod 0 as it relates to success at Turing:
  1. A takeaway from the first 2 sessions of Mod 0 is to get used to googling my questions first and try to find the answer on my own before asking.

  2. Another takeaway is that although being able to do the work efficiently is important, being able to work with others positively and collaboratively is equally if not more important.

#14 Add two new strategies you are committed to trying during the rest of Mod 0:
  1. **Use your time in breakout rooms efficiently**. My partner and I often didn't finish the assignment because we spent the beginning chatting and getting to know each other. Perhaps it would be more helpful to connect outside of class and maximize time to develop questions during breakout rooms.

  2. **A new strategy moving forward is to read, take notes, and try to complete the lesson and homework if possible before class.** During Session 2 I found myself confused and trying to catch up the whole time, rather than spending that time in class as I did with Session 1 - following along, asking questions, and absorbing the lesson. What we went over in Session 2 only started to make sense as soon as I started the homework.



Hello making some changes :)
